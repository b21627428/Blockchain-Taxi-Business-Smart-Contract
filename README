<------------The Problem-------------->
A group of people in the same neighborhood who would like to invest into an asset. They cannot invest
individually because each person has a very small amount of money, thus they can combine their holdings together
to invest into a bigger and more profitable investment.
They decided to combine their money and buy a car which will be used as a taxi and the profit will be shared
among participants every month. However, one problem is that they have no trust in each other. 



The problem was solved by a smart contract with struct structure suitable for object oriented programming.Lots of modifiers used for authorization and validation mechanisms. 

The requirements are below to smart contract work properly.

Solidity version: 0.6.11
Gas Limit: 3900000
